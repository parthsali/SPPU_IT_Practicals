## Assignment-01-B : User Registration with JSONPlaceholder API and Local Storage

#### This project demonstrates a web application for user registration using the JSONPlaceholder API and local storage. It leverages JavaScript's AJAX functionality to interact with the API and store user data locally.

### Key Functionalities:

- **User Registration Form**: Captures user information (email, name, username, phone, city, password).
- **AJAX POST**: Sends user data to the JSONPlaceholder API (for demonstration purposes).
- **Local Storage**: Stores registered user data on the client-side for potential retrieval (optional, depending on your needs).
- **User List**: Displays a table of registered users with details.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML**: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS** (Optional): Styles the layout and appearance of the elements (not included in this example).
- **JavaScript**: Manages user interactions, AJAX communication, and local storage operations.
- **Bootstrap (Optional)**: Provides pre-built components for a more responsive interface (included in this example).

### Getting Started:

- **Prerequisites**: Have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Familiarity with AJAX and local storage is beneficial.
- **Set Up Files**: Create HTML `index.html`, JavaScript `main.js`, and CSS (optional, `style.css`) files.
- **Code Implementation**: Integrate the provided code snippets into your files (refer to the code section below).
- **Run the Application**: Open index.html in your web browser to start user registration
