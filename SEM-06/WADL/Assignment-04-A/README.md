## Assignment-04-A : Simple Mobile Website with jQuery Mobile

#### This project demonstrates the creation of a basic mobile website using the jQuery Mobile framework. jQuery Mobile simplifies building responsive, touch-friendly websites that adapt to various screen sizes on mobile devices.

### Learning Objectives:

#### Gain practical experience with jQuery Mobile for mobile web development. Understand the core concepts of creating mobile-friendly user interfaces (UIs). Apply basic JavaScript techniques to handle form submissions.

#### Instructions:

**1. Project Setup:**

- Create a new directory for your project.
- Inside the directory, create the following files:

  - `index.html` (main HTML file)
  - `styles.css` (CSS styles) (Optional: for customizing website appearance)
  - `script.js` (jQuery Mobile and custom JavaScript)

**2. HTML Structure:**

- **Mobile Page Structure:** Wrap your website's content within a `div` element with the `data-role="page"` attribute. This instructs jQuery Mobile to render the content as a mobile page.
- **Header, Content, and Footer:** Utilize `div` elements with appropriate `data-role` attributes to define the header, content area, and footer of your website.
- **Include jQuery Mobile Library:** Link the jQuery Mobile library in your `<head>` section using either a CDN link or a local file reference.

**3. Styling (Optional):**

- Apply basic styling to your mobile website in a separate CSS file (`styles.css`) to enhance its visual appeal.

**4. JavaScript Interaction:**

- **Include jQuery:** Include the jQuery library before jQuery Mobile in your `<head>` section.
- **Form Handling (Optional):** Use JavaScript code to handle form submissions, validate input (if necessary), and perform desired actions (e.g., display alert messages, send data to a server).
- **Explore jQuery Mobile Widgets:** Experiment with various jQuery Mobile widgets for interactive elements like buttons, lists, menus, and more (optional).

**Additional Notes:**

- You can access the official jQuery Mobile documentation for a comprehensive reference: https://api.jquerymobile.com/
- Refer to tutorials and online resources to explore more advanced features and styling options in jQuery Mobile.
